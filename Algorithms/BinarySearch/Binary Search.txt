Algorithm: Binary Search

Input: 
Sorted list of elements
Element that you are looking for

Output: 
Returns the position of the element, if it is in the list
If it is not in the list, it returns null

Number of steps:
For a list of n, binary search will take log base 2(n) steps in the worst case

List of 100 elements = log base 2(100) = 6.64 = 7

List of 10 elements = log base 2(10) = 3.32 = 4

Worst complexity: O(log n)

Average complexity: O(log n)

Best complexity: O(1)

Space complexity: O(1)

Data structure: Array

Class: Search algorithm
